# Concept

Have a chat system that
 * works over SMTP
 * could work with anybody using email (even if not using this chat system)
 * distributed
 
Requirements:
 * support normal emails 
 * generate normal emails
 * cut footers
 * inline previews
 * link to originals/serve originals
 * groups (try to keep privacy if possible)
 * connect (don't accept every email/sender)
 * support arbitrary attachments (location, text, image, audio)
 * calculate delay (send/receive)

Important headers:
 * references, in-repy-to
 * x-fxnet-chatmail
 * subject (needed at all?)
 * from, to, return-path

## transport layer:
 * resync on start (fetch every mail since last seen)
 * listen to new mails
 * receive: from any mail that has "x-fxnet-chatmail" header extract the message to storage
 * send: package message to mail, set header, send over smtp server

## Storage
 * storage for any file
 * messages

## Message
 *
